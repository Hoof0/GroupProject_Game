Act 1: The Murder

log-01:

Good afternoon passengers. This is your captain speaking. First I'd like to welcome everyone on Finorza Flight 77F. We are currently cruising at an altitude of 33,000 feet at an airspeed of 400 miles per hour. The time is 3:47 pm. The weather looks good, and with the tailwind on our side, we are expecting to land in Tokyo approximately fifteen minutes ahead of schedule. The weather in Tokyo is clear and sunny, with a high of 25 degrees for this afternoon. If the weather cooperates, we should get a great view of the city as we descend. The cabin crew will be coming around in about twenty minutes to offer you a light snack and beverage. I'll talk to you again before we reach our destination. Until then, sit back, relax and enjoy the rest of the flight.

In the first class cabin…

Hoof Kaslei (Player): 
(sigh)
It has been so long since I had the time for such a wonderful vacation. Though, if any unfortunate thing happens, I might just hide myself and not interfere… At least…

Mika Sato:
(approaching you with a polished smile)
“Welcome aboard, Mr. Kaslei. Champagne? Or something stronger to help you… relax?”
(Her tone is playful, but her eyes linger a beat too long on the empty first-class seat reserved for Victor Kane, who hasn’t boarded yet.)

Hoof Kaslei:
(grunts, stowing his briefcase under the seat)
“Just water. And save the small talk—I’m here to sleep, not chat.”

Mika Sato:
(pours water into a glass, her locket swinging forward slightly)
“Of course. Long flights can be draining. But if you change your mind…”
(She nods to the trolley. A pen with a NovaTech logo—identical to the syringe-pen later used to kill Victor—rolls into view. She quickly tucks it away.)

Hoof Kaslei:
(narrows eyes at the pen)
“You techies and your gadgets. That thing record conversations too?”

Mika Sato:
(laughs, too sharp)
“Just a souvenir from a… difficult passenger. Let me know if you need anything else.”

(She moves down the aisle, her smile tightening as she stops at Alex Rivera, slumped in his seat with a half-empty coffee cup.)

…

Mika Sato:
“Another coffee, sir? You’ve been awake since takeoff.”

Alex Rivera:
(startled, spills coffee on his shirt)
“N-no! I’m fine. Totally fine. Just… jet lag.”

Mika Sato:
(noticing his trembling hands, softens)
“...I’ll bring you a blanket. You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

…

Mika Sato:
“Ms. Voss, your usual gin tonic?”

Clara Voss:
(doesn’t look up, voice icy)
“Tell Victor I don’t want his ‘courtesy drinks’ when he boards. I’m not here to network.”

Mika Sato:
(pours the drink anyway, placing it beside Clara’s laptop)
“He’ll be seated in 2A. I’m sure he’ll insist on saying hello.”

…

Mika Sato (to Harrison):
“Whiskey, neat? You’ve barely touched your last one.”

Harrison Gray:
(slams the notebook shut, revealing a crumpled photo of Victor)
“What I need is for this flight to land. Before I—”
(He stops himself, glaring at Victor’s empty seat.)

Mika Sato:
(gently replaces his glass)
“Some things are best served cold, Mr. Gray.”
log-03:

The flight is getting a bit too long. You decided to go to the restroom for some… personal stuff… Then, something caught your attention…

Aurora Antonae:
(adjusting her scarf to hide her platinum streak, voice clipped)
“First Class is restless. The NovaTech contingent keeps demanding upgrades. As if we stock unicorn caviar.”
(She loads a tray with champagne flutes, her gloved hands lingering on a NovaTech pen identical to Mika’s syringe-weapon.)

Mika Sato:
(stiffening, her locket chain peeking out)
“Ignore them. They’ll drown in their own entitlement soon enough.”

Aurora Antonae:
(noticing Mika’s locket, smirking)
“Still clinging to that? Sentimentality’s a liability, senpai. Especially around vipers like—”
(She nods toward Victor Kane’s empty seat.)

Mika Sato:
(cutting her off, icy)
“Focus on the champagne, Aurora. Or I’ll reassign you to diaper duty in Economy.”

(Aurora rolls her eyes and exits the galley, nearly colliding with you, who’s ambling toward the lavatory. She pastes on a flawless smile.)

Aurora Antonae:
(blocking his path with the trolley, saccharine-sweet)
“Mr. Kaslei! Can I interest you in our exclusive pre-landing martini? Shaken, not stirred—just like your Instagram posts.”

Hoof Kaslei:
(not looking up from his phone)
“I’m good. Move the cart.”

Aurora Antonae:
(leaning in, faux-concerned)
“Of course. Though, a word of advice? The lavatory lock jams. Wouldn’t want you trapped inside… unable to call your lawyer.”

Hoof Kaslei:
(finally glancing at her, deadpan)
“You’re real invested in my bladder. Got a medical degree too?”

Aurora Antonae:
(laughs lightly, adjusting her glove to reveal the scar on her wrist)
“Just hospitality training. We’re taught to anticipate every need.”
(She moves aside, her smile fading as he passes.)

You pause near the galley, pretending to fix your shoe. Inside, Mika and Aurora resume talking.

Mika Sato:
(hissing)
“Why provoke him? He’s harmless.”

Aurora Antonae:
(snorting)
“Harmless? Rich brats like him are fleas. But don’t worry—I’ll keep him too distracted to notice your… projects.”

You enter the lavatory and look around, without any care regarding what you have just heard. 

Hoof Kaslei: That damn woman… Well, it’s better for me though, I do NOT want to deal with any drama on my holiday, MY PRECIOUS HOLIDAY.

Just as you were grunting about the insufferable attendants, you hear a loud scream. 

log-04:

Flight Attendant: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HE’S DEAD!!!!!

You rush towards the source of the scream.

Aurora Antonae: 
“Girl, what's going on her- Oh! Hey Mika! It's that thing again!”

Mika Sato:
(coolly adjusting her scarf over her locket)
“Yes, I heard the scream. Now what?”

Aurora Antonae:
(shrugging, popping a mint into her mouth)
“Not my business, senpai. I’m too used to these already. There’s not much we can do when someone suddenly dies mid-air, you know? Unless…”
(She glances mockingly at the panicking passengers.)
“…someone on this flight is a policeman on vacation or something.”

Mika Sato:
(deadpan, turning to secure the galley)
“I’m grateful for your completely helpful words, Ms. Aurora.”

(Aurora winks at you, who’s hovering nearby, and holds up a champagne bottle.)

Aurora Antonae (to you):
“Refill, Mr. Kaslei? Might be your last chance before we all die horribly.”

Player Choice
(The captain’s voice booms over the intercom: “REMAIN CALM. WE ARE DIVERTING TO THE NEAREST AIRPORT.” you stare at Victor’s body, the syringe-pen, and the chaos around him.)

» CHOICE 1:
“Investigate the body.”
(You kneel beside Victor, noticing the syringe-pen’s NovaTech branding and a faint bitter almond smell—aconite. Proceed to the mystery.)

» CHOICE 2:
“Not my problem. I’m on holiday.”
(You retreats to his seat, puts on noise-canceling headphones, and mutters: “MY PRECIOUS HOLIDAY.”)

Immediate Game Over (Choice 2)
(The plane lands hours later. Police arrest Aurora Antonae—framed by Mika via planted evidence. Headlines scream: “NOVATECH CEO MURDERED BY DISGRUNTLED FLIGHT ATTENDANT.”

Hoof Kaslei (ending narration):
(sipping a tropical drink on a beach, scrolling past the news)
“Huh. Guess rich guys do have enemies. …Wait, was that the lady with the scar? Whatever.”

[[GAME OVER: “Ignorance is (Bitter) Bliss”]]
