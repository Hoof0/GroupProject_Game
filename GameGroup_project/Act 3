Investigation Paths

True Path (Revealing Mika Sato):

Review the syringe-pen in the galley trash—note the aconite residue and NovaTech branding.

Dialogue:
Lab Tech: "This pen’s tip tests positive for aconite."
Kaslei: "That aligns with the toxin found in Victor’s pillow."

Cross-check NovaTech inventory for matching pens and discover only crew-issued pens were on board.

Dialogue:
NovaTech Rep: "No external pens were logged—only crew supplies."
Kaslei: "Then the pen must belong to someone on this flight."

Match the torn photo half found in Mika’s locket with Victor’s pocket fragment—establish personal connection.

Dialogue:
Kaslei: "Your locket contains half of this photo—do you recognize him?"
Mika: "He… he was my mentor. But I didn’t kill him!"

Confront Mika with the combined evidence (poisoned pen + personal motive) and obtain her admission.

Dialogue:
Kaslei: "Poison in your pen, motive from the photo—explain yourself."
Mika (breaking down): "It was justice… he betrayed me years ago. I had to stop him."

False Path 1 (Framing Aurora):

Follow the champagne flute with Aurora’s fingerprints stained with aconite—chain of custody leads to galley cleanup.

Dialogue:
Kaslei: "Aurora, did you touch this flute?"
Aurora: "Yes—I served it, but I saw no poison."

Trace serving schedules to Aurora, but find her catering pen was clean.

Dialogue:
Kaslei: "Your pen shows zero toxins."
Aurora: "I told you—my tools are safe."

Hit dead end when lab analysis shows the flute was poisoned before Aurora touched it.

Dialogue:
Lab Tech: "Poison residue predates fingerprint deposition."
Kaslei: "Looks like someone set her up."

False Path 2 (Blaming Alex Rivera):

Investigate the sedative-laced coffee cup at Alex’s seat—assume he administered drugs.

Dialogue:
Kaslei: "Alex, why did you drug yourself?"
Alex: "I didn’t—it wasn’t mine."

Discover Alex’s insulin pen in his bag and confuse it with the poison syringe.

Dialogue:
Kaslei: "This broke device—was it used?"
Alex: "It’s my insulin pen—no poison."

Realize the breakage is due to his medical condition and not foul play, disproving the path.

Dialogue:
Kaslei: "The sedative came from a different source."
Alex: "Please find who did this to me."

False Path 3 (Targeting Clara Voss):

Analyze lavatory security footage showing Clara entering twice—presume opportunity.

Dialogue:
Kaslei: "Why two visits, Clara?"
Clara: "I felt unwell—I had to go again."

Check her medical logs to confirm she was ill, undermining the suspicion.

Dialogue:
Nurse: "She reported stomach cramps an hour before."
Kaslei: "Makes sense, but no poison found."

Evidence shows no poison in the lavatory or on her person.

Dialogue:
Lab Tech: "Negative on toxin swabs."
Kaslei: "Clara is innocent."

False Path 4 (Implicating Harrison Gray):

Examine the threatening note under Harrison’s seat—match handwriting to his.

Dialogue:
Kaslei: "This is your handwriting, Harrison."
Harrison: "I write notes all the time."

Search his briefcase, but find multiple innocent notes and no poison.

Dialogue:
Kaslei: "Only personal reminders here."
Harrison: "Nothing malicious."

Handwriting match is due to reused stationery—path collapses without toxic evidence.

Dialogue:
Stationery Rep: "These sheets are standard issue."
Kaslei: "So the note was a red herring."
